# Cloud-Based Customer Churn ML Pipeline

## Overview
This project implements a production-style data engineering and machine learning pipeline
to predict customer churn using cloud-based ETL, SQL feature engineering, and XGBoost.

## Architecture
- Cloud storage for raw and processed data
- SQL-based transformation and feature engineering
- Modular ML training and evaluation pipeline

## Tech Stack
- AWS (S3, Athena / Redshift)
- SQL
- Python
- XGBoost

## Project Structure

## ETL Pipeline
- Extract: Ingest raw customer and event data into S3
- Transform: Clean and aggregate data using SQL
- Load: Store curated and feature-ready datasets

## Machine Learning
- Feature ingestion from SQL outputs
- XGBoost model training
- Model evaluation and metrics

## Status
🚧 Initial setup in progress
